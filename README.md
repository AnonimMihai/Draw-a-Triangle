# Draw-a-Triangle
I have made a project in python where you enter the length of the sides of a triangle, the program automatically calculates all the angles of the triangle and draws it.

To run it you need to:
First Method (easy):
  Have Python installed and run the "main.py" script
Second Method (medium):
  Have Python and Pyinstaller installed, run the command "pyinstaller --onefile /path/to/main.py" where "/path/to/main.py" is the location of the "main.py" script.
  If you use Windows you will need to do "pyinstaller --onefile \path\to\main.py"
